# Connect everything to IoT 

> The project was to connect TPR Holder to the Internet of Things in order to measure the paper flow and paper level. As sensors we using IR Emitter/Detector and Piezo element and LightBlueBean. The demo shows the setup, data flow and a Dashboard using the Watson IoT Platform
